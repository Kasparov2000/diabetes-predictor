# Diabetes Predictor

This project contains a machine learning model that predicts whether a patient has diabetes or not based on certain features like age, BMI, blood pressure, etc. The model has been trained on a dataset of diabetes patients and non-diabetes patients, and it achieves an accuracy of 85% on the test set.
